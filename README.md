# ABOUT


While analyzing the fly movement, a difficulty is observed due to random stoppages 
of the fly. The code here gives corresponding coordinates of the fly where it has stopped 
for a duration more than the threshold that has been set. 

# DEPENDENCIES: 

MATLAB installed in the system.

# RUNNING THE CODE

The code can be run on the MATLAB software. 
The required ".mat" files are added here, which contains
all the parameteric details of the fly. 
The output will contain various durations of fly stoppages.
